I am working with [Prof. Frank Dellaert](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/FrankDellaert/Frank_Dellaert/Frank_Dellaert.html) on extends the SLAM problem in the time dimension, enabling better monitoring and data driven decision making.  Our current status is to develop techniques which enable better feature matches in the salad images. These images have lot of repeated texture which makes it very difficult to perform matches even for a human.

The report of my work in Fall 2019 is hosted [here](/files/SP_fall19_report.pdf).
