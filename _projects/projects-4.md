excerpt: "Compression directly on the temporal input using CNN based Autoencoders without frequency domain conversion"

We developed a deep learning system which can learn the latent space of music audio, and that will help us compress it. This domain has short-term and long-term temporal relationships (like beats/riffs) which pose a challenge to compress it. We also leverage the compressed latent space to predict the genre of music. The project website with demos is hosted [here](https://pgrady3.github.io/music-compression-web/).
