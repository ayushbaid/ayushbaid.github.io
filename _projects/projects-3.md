title: "Sleep Stage Prediction using Transformers"
excerpt: "Predict the sleep stage from EEG signals using a deep network of CNN+Transformers"
collection: projects
---
We propose a novel deep learning architecture on a single EEG channel using CNNs to extract features and Transformers to leverage neighboring temporal context to predict sleep stage label (Wake, REM, etc).
