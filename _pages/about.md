I am a Software Developer Engineer at Amazon, working in the Alexa Multitasking team. My team works on maintaining lifecycle of the skills executed by the customer, and support complex user experiences like multitasking, [skill backgrounding and resumption](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2020/07/make-it-easier-for-customers-to-pick-up-where-they-left-off-with-skill-resumption?sc_category=Owned&sc_channel=SM&sc_campaign=Social-Organic&sc_publisher=SM&sc_content=Content&sc_funnel=Convert&sc_country=WW&sc_medium=Owned_SM_Social-Organic_SM_Content_Convert_WW_Followers&sc_segment=Followers&ref=tsm_1_tw_s__3518014951&linkId=94854341).

I completed by MS in Computer Science in May 2021 from Georgia Tech. At Georgia Tech, I focussed with [Dr. Frank Dellaert](https://dellaert.github.io/) on GTSfM, a Structure-From-Motion software. My coursework was focussed on deep-learning and its applications in computer vision. 

I received my bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from [Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), with a minor in computer science. After my degree, I worked for 2 years after in the cloud team of the risk division, building and managing distributed computing systems. I also gravitated towards data engineering and prediction models towards the end of my stint there.
