I am a first year student at Georgia Tech, pursuing MS in computer science. Specialising in machine learning, I plan to focus on deep learning and computer vision in my program.

I worked at Goldman Sachs for 2 years in the cloud team of the risk division, building and managing distributed computing systems. I also gravitated towards data engineering and prediction models towards the end of my stint there.

I received my bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from [Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), with a minor in computer science.
