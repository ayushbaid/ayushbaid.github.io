# Job experience

## Amazon, SDE Intern (Alexa Multitasking)
#### May 2020 - Jul 2020, Seattle
* Developed a REST API to query Alexa skills data from AWS Redshift and used D3 to visualize lifecycle of fetched skills
* Reduced the time to understand interactions between multitasking skills from a couple of minutes to under 10 seconds

## Goldman Sachs, Analyst (Risk Division)
#### Jun 2017 - Jul 2019, Bengaluru (India)
* Contributed to ~10% drop in compute by upgrading the compute packaging and runtime prediction model
* Designed a microservices-based risk computation system; reduced debug time by 20% with granular diagnostics tools
* Developed automated monitoring and alert systems for data-store, messaging pipeline, and pricing progress status

## Sony Corporation, Intern (Test Technology)
#### May 2015 - Jul 2015, Tokyo
* Developed a cloud-based testing platform for Android applications with configuration based virtual device scheduling

# Key Projects

## GTSFM: Scalable Structure-From-Motion Pipeline
#### Dec 2019 - Present
* Developed a distributed front-end module using Dask to produce sparse correspondences between pairs of images
* Benchmarked 15000+ combinations of feature detection, matching, and verification methods for SLAM applications

## 3D Reconstruction for Precision Agriculture
#### Aug 2019 - Jan 2020
* Developed an automated system to produce 3D reconstructions of plants from RGB images of lettuce crops
* Improved performance of RANSAC by clustering features on each image with DBSCAN and filtering repeated texture

## Moderation on Reddit by Learning Community Opinion
#### Feb 2020 - Apr 2020
* Fine-tuned GPT-1 on each subreddit and used them to complete political prompts, reducing the moderator workload

## Deep Learning based Image Translation between Sunny-Cloudy Images
#### Oct 2019 - Nov 2019
* Used cycle-GANs to translate to convert cloudy images to sunny using novel content similarity component in the loss

## Laparoscopy Image Enhancement using Bayesian Inference
#### Jun 2016 - Jun 2017
* Achieved performance gain by combining smoke removal, speckle removal, and de-noising in a single framework
* Modelled system variables with probabilistic graphical models and designed novel priors for image texture and color

## FOSSEE Scilab Toolbox
#### Dec 2015 - Jan 2017
* Developed and tested signal processing functions for signal processing toolbox, emulating the MATLABâ€™s API
