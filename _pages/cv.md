# Job experience

## SDE Intern, Amazon (Alexa Multitasking)
#### May 2020 - Jul 2020, Seattle
* Developed a REST API to query Alexa skill execution data from AWS Redshift and used D3 to visualize their lifecycle
* Reduced the time to comprehend interactions between multitasking skills from two minutes to under 10 seconds

## Analyst, Goldman Sachs (Risk Division)
#### Jun 2017 - Jul 2019, Bengaluru (India)
* Contributed to ~3% drop in compute bill by upgrading the compute packaging and runtime prediction model
* Designed a microservice-based risk computation system; reduced debug time by 20% with granular diagnostics tool
* Developed automated monitoring and alert systems for data-stores, messaging pipeline, and pricing progress status

## Intern, Sony Corporation (Test Technology)
#### May 2015 - Jul 2015, Tokyo
* Developed an online Android app testing service to support configurable virtual devices instead of physical devices

# Key Projects

## GTSFM: Scalable Structure-From-Motion Pipeline
#### Dec 2019 - Present
* Developed a distributed front-end module using Dask to produce sparse correspondences between pairs of images
* Benchmarked 15000+ combinations of feature detection, matching, and verification methods for SLAM front-end

## 3D Reconstruction for Precision Agriculture
#### Aug 2019 - Jan 2020
* Developed an automated system to produce 3D reconstructions of plants from RGB images of lettuce crops
* Improved performance of RANSAC by clustering features on each image with DBSCAN and filtering self-similar texture

## Moderation on Reddit by Learning Community Opinion
#### Feb 2020 - Apr 2020
* Used GPT to complete ~100 prompts after training on each subreddit, reducing human effort from million to ~100

## Deep Learning based Image Translation between Sunny-Cloudy Images
#### Oct 2019 - Nov 2019
* Used cycle-GANs to translate to convert cloudy images to sunny using novel content similarity component in the loss

## Laparoscopy Image Enhancement using Bayesian Inference
#### Jun 2016 - Jun 2017
* Achieved performance gain by combining smoke removal, speckle removal, and de-noising in a single framework
* Modeled system variables with probabilistic graphical models and designed novel priors for image texture and color

## FOSSEE Scilab Toolbox
#### Dec 2015 - Jan 2017
* Developed and tested signal processing functions for signal processing toolbox, emulating the MATLABâ€™s API
