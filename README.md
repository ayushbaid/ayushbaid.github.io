## Bio

I am a first year student at Georgia Tech, pursuing MS in computer science. Specialising in machine learning, I plan to focus on deep learning and computer vision in my program.

I worked at Goldman Sachs for 2 years in the cloud team of the risk division, building and managing distributed computing systems. I also gravitated towards data engineering and prediction models towards the end of my stint there.

I received my bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from [Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), with a minor in computer science.

## Research

#### Spatio-Temporal (4D) reconstruction of salad crops

I am working with [Prof. Frank Dellaert](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/FrankDellaert/Frank_Dellaert/Frank_Dellaert.html) on extends the SLAM problem in the time dimension, enabling better monitoring and data driven decision making.  Our current status is to develop techniques which enable better feature matches in the salad images. These images have lot of repeated texture which makes it very difficult to perform matches even for a human.

The report of my work in Fall 2019 is hosted [here](./reports/SP_fall19_report.pdf).



#### Enhancement of Laparoscopy images

I was a part of the [ViGIL](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/graphics/doku.php?id=start) research group at IIT Bombay, where I pursued my thesis under the guidance of  [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/) and [Prof. Shabbir Merchant](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/merchant/). We worked on removing random noise, surgical smoke, and speckles from the laparoscopy images. These corruptions perturb the texture and color of the organs, and make the surgical experience unpleasant, and reduce the efficacy of automated algorithms. We modelled the system using Markov random fields, and designed potential functions using color distribution priors and dictionary priors (to model texture). We used variational Bayesian factorization to make the optimization tractable using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. 

A graphical abstract is hosted [here](./iitb_thesis/Graphical_abstract.pdf). We had an oral presentation at [IEEE ISBI](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2019/) 2017 ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7950623)). The full thesis can be found [here](./iitb_thesis/thesis.pdf). I was awarded the Undergraduate Research Award 03 (URA-03) for my work.

## Academic Projects

I have done projects in areas like computer vision, medical image processing, and machine learning.

Here are some of the work I have done/am currently doing:
1. **Music Audio Compression**: I am currently working on developing a deep learning system which can learn the latent space of music audio, and that will help us compress it. This domain as a short-term and long-term temporal relationships (like beats/riffs) which pose a challenge to compress it. We also plan to analyse the latent space to see if it can improve the genre and timeframe-of-release predictions. The project website with demos is hosted [here](https://pgrady3.github.io/music-compression-web/).
2. **Sunny-cloudy image translation using cycle-GANs**: We used cycle-GANs with some modifications in the generator-discriminator architecture and introduced a new content similarity loss to perform image translation between these two classes. The report is hosted [here](./reports/cycle-gans.pdf). 
3. **Medical Image Processing**: studied various imaging techniques like CT-scan and MRI, and implemented algorithms to de-noise, segment, etc. ([Summary](https://ayushbaid.github.io/mip_iitb/))
4. **Computer Vision**: learnt and implemented algorithms for image registration, segmentation, classification, and basic compressed sensing techniques. ([Summary](https://ayushbaid.github.io/cv_iitb/))

## Data Analytics

Data is the key to unlock new insights, and validate hypothesis we might be holding since a long time.

Currently, I wrote a short script to gain some insights on the competitiveness of different football leagues.  European football has five big leagues: English, Spanish, German, French, and Italian. You can find the work [here](https://ayushbaid.github.io/football_stats).
