## Bio
I have been working at Goldman Sachs for about 2 years. I received my bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from [Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/).

## Research

#### Enhancement of Laparoscopy images

I was a part of the [ViGIL](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/graphics/doku.php?id=start) research group at IIT Bombay, where I pursued my thesis under the guidance of  [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/) and [Prof. Shabbir Merchant](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/merchant/). We worked on removing random noise, surgical smoke, and speckles from the laparoscopy images. These corruptions perturb the texture and color of the organs, and make the surgical experience unpleasant, and reduce the efficacy of automated algorithms. We modelled the system using Markov random fields, and designed potential functions using color distribution priors and dictionary priors (to model texture). We used variational Bayesian factorization to make the optimization tractable using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. 

A graphical abstract is hosted [here](./iitb_thesis/Graphical_abstract.pdf). We had an oral presentation at [IEEE ISBI](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2019/) 2017 ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7950623)). The full thesis can be found [here](./iitb_thesis/thesis.pdf). I was awarded the Undergraduate Research Award 03 (URA-03) for my work.



## Academic Projects

I have done projects in areas like computer vision, medical image processing, and machine learning.

Here are some of the work I have done:

1. Medical Image Processing: studied various imaging techniques like CT-scan and MRI, and implemented algorithms to denoise, segment, etc. ([Summary](https://ayushbaid.github.io/mip_iitb/))
2. Computer Vision: learnt and implemented algorithms for image registration, segmentation, classification, and basic compressed sensing techniques. ([Summary](https://ayushbaid.github.io/cv_iitb/))



## Data analytics

Data is the key to unlock new insights, and validate hypothesis we might be holding since a long time.

Currently, I am working on characterising the competitiveness of different football leagues.  European football has five big leagues: English, Spanish, German, French, and Italian. You can find the work [here](https://ayushbaid.github.io/football_stats).
