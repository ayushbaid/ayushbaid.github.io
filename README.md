## Bio
I have been working at Goldman Sachs for about 2 years. I receieved my Bachelors and Masters degree in electrical engineering from [Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/).

You can find my resume [here](https://ayushbaid.github.io/resume/cv_long.pdf).



## Research

#### Enhancement of Laparoscopy images

I was a part of the [ViGIL](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/graphics/doku.php?id=start) research group at IIT Bombay, where I pursued my thesis under the guidance of  [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/) and [Prof. Shabbir Merchant](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/merchant/). We worked on removing random noise, surgical smoke, and speckles from the laparoscopy images. These corruptions perturb the texture and color of the organs, and make the surgical experience unpleasant, and reduce the efficacy of automated algorithms. We modelled the system using Markov random fields, and designed potential functions using color distribution priors and dictionary priors (to model texture).

A graphical abstract is hosted [here](./iitb_thesis/Graphical_abstract.pdf). We had an oral presentation at [IEEE ISBI](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2019/) 2017 ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7950623)). The full thesis can be found [here](./iitb_thesis/thesis.pdf).



## Projects

I have done projects in areas like computer vision, medical image processing, and machine learning.

Here are some of the work I have done:

1. Medical Image Processing: studied various imaging techniques like CT-scan and MRI, and implemented algorithms to denoise, segment, etc. A short summary can be found [here](https://ayushbaid.github.io/mip_iitb/).
2. Computer Vision: learnt and implemented algorithms for image registration, segmentation, classification, and basic compressed sensing techniques. A short webpage is hosted [here](https://ayushbaid.github.io/cv_iitb/).
